# teddit

[teddit.net](https://teddit.net)

A free and open source alternative Reddit front-end focused on privacy.
Inspired by the [Nitter](https://github.com/zedeus/nitter) project.

* No JavaScript or ads
* All requests go through the backend, client never talks to Reddit
* Prevents Reddit from tracking your IP or JavaScript fingerprint
* [Unofficial API](https://codeberg.org/teddit/teddit/wiki#teddit-api) (RSS & JSON support, no rate limits or Reddit account required)
* Lightweight (teddit frontpage: ~30 HTTP requests with ~270 KB of data downloaded vs. Reddit frontpage: ~190 requests with ~24 MB)
* Self-hostable. Anyone can setup an instance. An instance can either use Reddit's API with or without OAuth (so Reddit API key is not necessarily needed).

## Changelog

See ```CHANGELOG.md```
## Installation

### Docker

Using [Docker and `docker-compose`](https://github.com/docker/compose):

```console
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

Teddit should now be running at <http://localhost:8080>.

### Manual

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).

1. (Optional) Install [redis-server](https://redis.io).

   Highly recommended – it works as a cache for Reddit API calls.

1. (Optional) Install [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org).

   It's needed if you want to support videos.

   ```console
   # Linux
   apt install redis-server ffmpeg

   # macOS
   brew install redis
   ```

1. Clone and set up the repository.

   ```console
   git clone https://codeberg.org/teddit/teddit
   cd teddit
   npm install --no-optional
   cp config.js.template config.js # edit the file to suit your environment
   redis-server
   npm start
   ```

Teddit should now be running at <http://localhost:8080>.
